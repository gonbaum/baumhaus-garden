      <p>
        To kickstart this project, I've first created a repo in github and then
        bootstrapped a Next.js app locally by using the command: npx
        create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example
        "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
        taken from the offical documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once running, I've created my first post (this one) and then proceeded
        to create a Gitlab project by importing my github repository dedicated
        to the project. I had to create a personal token for this and once this
        was done, I've also created a gitlab-ci.yml file with some 'mock
        pipeline' that tells if the push is made on the main branch or any other
        branch.
