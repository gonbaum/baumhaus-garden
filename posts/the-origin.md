To kickstart this project, I've first created a repo in github and then
bootstrapped a Next.js app locally by using the command: npx
create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example
"https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
taken from the offical documentation.

Once running, I've created my first post (this one) and then proceeded
to create a Gitlab project by importing my github repository dedicated
to the project. I had to create a personal token for this and once this
was done, I've also created a gitlab-ci.yml file with some 'mock
pipeline' that tells if the push is made on the main branch or any other
branch.
