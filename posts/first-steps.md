After succesfully created my Gitlab project, I've proceeded to
containerize my app and setting up a Kubernetes cluster in GCP via
Gitlab CI/CD integration.

For containerize the app, I realised that we can use the example
Dockerfile from the official Next.js documentation. Once created the
file I've created the image and run a container locally to test it, by
exposing the port 3000. Commands used: docker build . -t
nextjs-baumhaus-garden docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-baumhaus-garden
